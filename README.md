## Installation

Before you can do anything with the project, you will need to [download and install libosu](https://github.com/K3VRAL/libosu).

The tools you will also need before you can do anything is `make`, `gcc`/`gcc-mingw` and `pkg-config`.

Once you have the necessary tools and the library has been installed, in your terminal while still in the same folder location of this project's `Makefile`, write `make`, to compile the project to a binary, then `sudo make install` to install the binary.

If you wish to uninstall the program, do `sudo make uninstall` and that should get rid of everything.
