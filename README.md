# BananaPredictor

Using .Net Core 5 and osu Catch Rulesets from lazer

This program will be able to predict where the next banana xoffset will be placed and either remove or leave it be depending on the area you want the banana to be placed in.


PROJECT CURRENTLY DEAD

UPDATE:
At the moment, I've realized how difficult this project will be in order to be able to complete it. RNG is generated through the amount of spinners/sliders(/HR Objects?) are used; not when they are: placed differently, placed in different times, BPM changed, Velocity changes, etc.
The only way to change how a banana is placed is if the RNG is determined by the factor of the amount of spinners/sliders(/HR Objects?) placed and it makes this project very fustrating since the only factor I wanted to use to be able to determine the banana xOffset was from the spinner itself;
but now having to also use sliders as another realiable factor to be able to randomly place the objects in different areas has defeated me and I spent a scarily amount of time into this. I'll leave this project for now until I have the mentality and understanding of how sliders work (Phob seems to know this a lot).

INITIAL INTENTION AND REFLECTION:
The way how I originally wanted to do was to be able to first predict where the banana was going to go (done), move the spinner accordingly to where I wanted the banana to go (sort've done?) and, well, that was it. I should've read more closely because that wasn't how osu was programmed; as in it was programmed to receive objects and change the rng, which I didn't see for some reason until very late into development. After realizing this, I still had an idea to fix this but now the program would be more focused on DTB styles or placing spinners and sliders on top of each other. This still is my vision on how I can save this project but trying to understand how sliders work has proven to be an even greater challenge than what spinners provided since inheritage (BPM) and uninheritage (Velocity) points as well as curved and other such factors would need to be taken into account; and spending over a week, hours a day (around 5-6) with my free time taken up as a result to my interest has definatly taken a toll on my mentality. Problem solving and being dedicated to your craft is fun and all, but when you expect to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and don't, it gets fustrating, especially for long periods of time. I'll focus on other projects and ideas I want to express so until then, I will need the motivation to come back to this project later.

Thanks for reading.
