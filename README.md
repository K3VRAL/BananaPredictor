# BananaPredictor

Using .Net Core 5 and osu Catch Rulesets from lazer

This program will be able to predict where the next banana xoffset will be placed and either remove or leave it be depending on the area you want the banana to be placed in.


PROJECT CURRENTLY DEAD

UPDATE:
At the moment, I've realized how difficult this project will be in order to be able to complete it. RNG is generated through the amount of spinners/sliders(/HR Objects?) are used; not when they are: placed differently, placed in different times, BPM changed, Velocity changes, etc.
The only way to change how a banana is placed is if the RNG is determined by the factor of the amount of spinners/sliders(/HR Objects?) placed and it makes this project very fustrating since the only factor I wanted to use to be able to determine the banana xOffset was from the spinner itself;
but now having to also use sliders as another realiable factor to be able to randomly place the objects in different areas has defeated me and I spent a scarily amount of time into this. I'll leave this project for now until I have the mentality and understanding of how sliders work (Phob seems to know this a lot).
