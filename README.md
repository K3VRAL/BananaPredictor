Using [.Net Core SDK 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) and [osu Catch Rulesets](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ppy.osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch/) from lazer

This program will be able to predict where the next banana xoffset will be placed and either remove or leave it be depending on the area you want the banana to be placed in.

You can't right now. Everything has hardcoded values and is currently very broken. This will be fixed in future releases.

Under heavy development.
