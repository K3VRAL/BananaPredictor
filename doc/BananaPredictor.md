# Description

BananaPredictor is an application made to allow for the user to predict and place bananas in specific areas that they want. This is done so with the help of sliders as they help allow the spinner to change it's seed to be placed in another area. Because of how many sliders, droplets, or tiny droplets exists, we can be able to influence where the banana will end up based on how many times we can keep putting in these seed affecting objects.
