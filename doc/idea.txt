/* Explaination:
    start is 3000ms
    length of spinner is 6000ms relative to start
    spinner_length is every 1ms relative to start
    spinner_distance is every 3ms relative to start
    inverted is true and ends relative to start
    points are:
        - point 1
            - x is 10
            - time is 0ms relative to start
            - bezier is mandatorily false (as first point)
            - goes to point 2
        - point 2
            - x is 246
            - time is 0ms relative to start
            - bezier is false
            - goes to point 3
        - point 3
            - x is 186
            - time is 2000ms relative to start
            - bezier is true
            - goes to point 4
        - point 4
            - x is 246
            - time is 4000ms relative to start
